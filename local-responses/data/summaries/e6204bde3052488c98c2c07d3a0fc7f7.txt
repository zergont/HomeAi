Okay, the user wrote "–∫–∞–∫ –∂–∏—Ç—É—Ö–∞, –±—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ö–∞?" which is a playful way of asking how things are going. They used informal terms like "–∂–∏—Ç—É—Ö–∞" (life) and "–±—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ö–∞" (brother), so I should respond in a friendly, colloquial tone.

First, I need to acknowledge their greeting and match their casual style. Maybe use emojis or slang to keep it light. Since they mentioned "–±—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ö–∞," I can address them as a brother or friend. Also, they might be looking for a quick, humorous reply rather than a formal one.

I should make sure the response is positive and open-ended, inviting them to ask for help if needed. Maybe add some humor with a joke about AI or life in general. Keep it short and warm.
